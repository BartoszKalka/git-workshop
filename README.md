### Git Workshop
Hello ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Git Workshop. It's a very simple repository containing the basics of Git, some theory, good practices and exercises.
Hope you'll learn something new and enjoy whatever it is that you find here âœ¨

### What is Git?
Git is a version control system allowing for users to share their work (in most cases - programming) and publish it.
Git works uses hashes in a key-value form to save every action taken on the software. Every objects has it's hash value, which Git uses to navigate to whenever a change is made.
The structure resembles a tree ðŸŒ³ Additionally, each user has it's own copy of the repository on their local machine (contrary to an SVN system).
Another big difference between git and other version control systems is an access to the local history. In most cases you don't need to change your history of the files, however
it's permitted.
Git generally isn't a good place for storing big files (you can, however use the [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/))

### Branches
As mentioned before, git has a tree-like structure ðŸŒ³ it operates on branches, which can be merged/rebased/pulled from/pushed into whatever you need.

### Exercises:
1. Fork the repository
  * Make a branch
  * Make some changes
  * Stage your changes 
  * Commit those changes
  * Create a PR
  * Use git merge
  * Push to official repository
2. Clone the repository
  * Make a branch
  * Make some changes
  * Stage your changes 
  * Commit those changes
  * Create a PR
  * Use git rebase
  * Push to official repository
3. Set up an issue
4. Pull the branch a person on your left made in 2.
5. Pull a branch from the forked repository of the person on your right (from exercise 1.)
6. What's wrong with those PRs? ðŸ¤”
