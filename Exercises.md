### Basic level tasks

The repository you are currently in has a simple Python application inside it, which is a calculator. The application code can be found in the `calculator/calculator.py` directory. You have been assigned a user story for sprint planning to add additional functions to the calculator. So far, we have 4 functions that allow us to add, divide, multiply and subtract. Our client asks us to add two features:
- Exponentiating - Taking the arguments `x` as the base of the power and `y` as the exponent
- Square root - Taking only one argument `x` and calculating only the second degree root

Remember to add tests and docstings to these functions later.

**If you don't want to come up with these solutions yourself, the Answers section contains all the necessary changes to the files**
